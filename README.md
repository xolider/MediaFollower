# MediaFollower

MediaFollower is a Windows WinUI software that allows users to search and find informations about Movies and/or TV series. It shows for example the summary, trailers and casting for a specific movie/tv serie. In a future release, it will be possible to set a movie/tv serie as "seen", and the software will select related movies/tv serie that you could like.
